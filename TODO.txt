Version 1:

I want to create a button form submission in the turbo frame that updates a counter of some sort in order to test some concepts. I will create a button that says "Like" or "Unlike" and a text field that updates the number of likes. Since there is no user model, I can't create this in the traditional way. 

Contact page: 
- Does not require a resource. 

Flashcard: 
By default, display front. When clicked, display back. 
Create entries into the flashcard database
Update index.erbfile to display the text appropriately

Simple UI. 
- A flashcard that when clicked, "flips" and displays the "back."
- Left and right arrows that when clicked, display the previous and next flashcards respectively.
- Neither should require a full page reload.

Model:
- Flashcard with front:str, back:str

Routes:
Set index to flashcard
