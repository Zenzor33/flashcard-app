Version 1:

Logic changes: 

- Change the routes file to support POST requests by the correct and incorrect button. 

resources :flashcards do
  member do
    post :mark_correct
    post :mark_incorrect
  end
end

- The controller action handles the logic for when it receives the POST request of mark_correct vs mark_incorrect. 

To do this, we create controller actions with the same name as the POST request 

def mark_correct  
update_statistic(true)
render @flashcard
end 

def mark_incorrect 
update_statistic(false)
render @flashcard
end  

and a private method that handles the logic

private  

def update_statistic(is_correct) 
  flashcard = flashcard.find(params[:id])
  statistic = flashcard_statistic.find_or_initialize_by(user: current_user, flashcard: flashcard)

  if is_correct 
    statistic.correct_count += 1
  else 
    statistic.incorrect_count += 1
  end 

  statistic.save 
end 

Note that current_user is a helper method provided by devise. 

button and database changes:

I want to create a button form submission in the turbo frame that updates a counter of some sort in order to test some concepts. I will create a button that says "Like" or "Unlike" and a text field that updates the number of likes. Since there is no user model, I can't create this in the traditional way. 

I will add two buttons to the turboframe called "correct" and "incorrect," respectively. I will add two columns of type integer to the Flashcard model named "correct_count" and "incorrect_count." The count for a flashcard increment according to which button the user clicks. 

The UI will also display the statistics

My previous idea regarding the model changes was incorrect. Since I want to keep track of individual user statistics, I need to createa join model between User and Flashcard called FlashcardStatistic. 

FlashcardStatstic will have: 
correct_count: int 
incorrect_count: int 
user:references
flashcard:references 

rails g migration CreateFlashcardStatistics correct_count:integer:default=0 incorrect_count:integer:default=0 user:references flashcard:references

Model setup: 
Flashcard has_many Users 
Users has_many Flashcards
Users has_many FlashcardStatistics

Contact page: 
- Does not require a resource. 

Flashcard: 
By default, display front. When clicked, display back. 
Create entries into the flashcard database
Update index.erbfile to display the text appropriately

Simple UI. 
- A flashcard that when clicked, "flips" and displays the "back."
- Left and right arrows that when clicked, display the previous and next flashcards respectively.
- Neither should require a full page reload.

Model:
- Flashcard with front:str, back:str

Routes:
Set index to flashcard
